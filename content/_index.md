ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dane Walters

Iâ€™m a backend developer with a love for clean architecture, minimal abstractions, and well-crafted code.

My current stack revolves around Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but I also enjoy working with modern and expressive technologies like Deno, Hono.js, Elixir, and Phoenix. On the side, Iâ€™m exploring Rust, diving deeper into TypeScript, and brushing up on the fundamentals by relearning C â€” sometimes you have to go low-level to level up.

Iâ€™m especially interested in:
	â€¢	Building web APIs with Rails, Hono, and Phoenix
	â€¢	Writing developer tools and small backend services in Rust or Deno
	â€¢	Understanding systems from the ground up â€” OS, networking, and compilers
	â€¢	Clean code, automation, and performance tuning

This blog is where I share what Iâ€™m learning, working on, or just thinking about. Itâ€™s a mix of technical notes, side project logs, and occasional deep dives.

Thanks for stopping by â€” hope you find something useful here!
