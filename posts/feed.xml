		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since graduating, I’ve come to realize that time seems to be passing faster and faster. Sometimes it feels like I haven’t really learned much, and life hasn’t left me with many deep or lasting memories. By the time I noticed, a lot of time had already slipped away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying: “The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago. The second best time is now.” So I’ve decided to start this blog — not only as a way to share knowledge or thoughts, but more importantly, to document my life and learning.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to keep a steady pace of writing one post per week. And I hope this space becomes a small archive of growth, reflection, and progress.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
